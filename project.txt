AI integrated API Testing tool for beginners:

-web based API testing platform
-AI integration to explain the API endpoints, structure response etc
-(LAST PRIORITY)AI reads thru the files to find the fn implementation of the API endpoint.
-For publicly available APIs it provides a feature to find the documentation of the api and its endpoint explaining it to the beginner.

Project Roadmap:
-First we develop the basics of the APi testing platform that is adding an endpoint and the related request details(request body{json,text,variables,headers},endpoint url,method), sending requests,getting the response(body{status code,message,etc})
   *File Structure*
        -Model(reqest model,response model)
        -Service
        - History Model

Implementation:
- Planning on first building it as a web platform and then porting it to electron to make it a desktop app, enabling saving data like history and prev requests as local data hence avoiding the use of server.
- In activity section I want to be able to add new request, duplicate an existing one(just to make minor changes etc...), delete an activity.
- UI is dark blue based.It must have state management . Like incoming requests failed requests and everything should be refelcted.
